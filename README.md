MovieLens dataset exploratory analysis
MovieLens exploratory analysis was a part of self learning process concerning basic data analytics. I have learnt how to analyze and manipulate data using python libraries such as 
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and seaborn. 
I have also used basic descriptive statsitcal analysis such as univariate and bivariate analysis.
